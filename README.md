# Comprehensive Autonomous Driving System Leveraging Cityscapes Dataset using Deep Learning

# Project Statement:

The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive autonomous driving system that can perform semantic segmentation, object detection, lane detection, and traffic sign recognition. Using the Cityscapes dataset, we will train deep learning models to understand and interpret urban street scenes.

# Outcomes:
By the end of this project, students will:

• Understand and implement data preprocessing techniques for various computer vision tasks.

• Develop and train deep learning models for semantic segmentation, object detection, lane detection, and traffic sign recognition.

• Evaluate and improve the performance of these models using various metrics.

• Prepare detailed documentation and presentation of their findings and results.
